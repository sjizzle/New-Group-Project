# New-Group-Project - Sean Jackson - 100296566
Used canvas videos from Professor Ahmed, used bootstrap, font awesome, w3school, bootstrap, used stackoverflow for ECONNREFUSED error which said use 0.0.0.0:27017 for local host and it fixed. I tried to get help from the prof but he was not feeling well. 
Fixed error ../nodue_module for path errors.

Code help from the TA - Tanzina on Fridat Dec 4th, 2022 during Tutorial - Help from the prof on previous program which in turn helped on the building of this app.
*** Terminal errors - unable to push/commit from VS code without breaking my program and error messgaes.

The building blocks for this web app is the canvas videos.
