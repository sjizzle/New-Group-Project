Used canvas videos from Professor Ahmed, used bootstrap, font awesome, w3school, bootstrap, used stackoverflow for ECONNREFUSED error which said use 0.0.0.0:27017 for local host and it fixed this issue. I researched more to further understand. Would love Professor Ahmed to follow up on the rational (if possible).
I tried to get help from the prof but he was not feeling well. 

Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14168433/node-js-error-connect-econnrefused

Fixed error ../node_module for path errors.

Code help from the TA - Tanzina on Fridat Dec 4th, 2022 during Tutorial - Help from the prof on previous program which in turn helped on the building of this app.
*** Terminal errors - unable to push/commit from VS code without breaking my program and error messgaes.Notified TA as well of the issue with localhost/Survey not working or the mongoDB cloud connecting but failing to display DB or gives a Error for login. 

The building blocks for this web app is mainly the canvas videos.

broke app after last commit - copy and pasted my VS Code Survey program manually :(

Update - Study Folder Dec 5th - in preparation for Release V3.
